"""Guard test: every tool name cited in prose must resolve to a registered tool.

Prompts, resources, and the shipped skill files tell the model which tools to call.
A name in that text that the server does not register is a dead end the model cannot
detect: it reads as an instruction, the call fails, and nothing in the codebase links
the prose back to the tool that was renamed or folded away.

This is the ratchet for that class of drift. It fired for real when 21 per-protocol
tools were consolidated into `wireshark_analyze_protocol` — the names survived in five
prompts and two skill documents after the tools were gone.
